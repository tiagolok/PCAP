for i in range(100):
    # do_something()
    pass
# note the pass keyword inside the loop body - it does nothing at all; it's an empty instruction -
# we put it here because the for loop's syntax demands at least one instruction inside the body
# (by the way - if, elif, else and while express the same thing)
